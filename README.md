# MC_DepthNN
An attempt at a neural network which takes photos of Minecraft as input and outputs a depth estimation. Works on 512x512 screenshots of the minecraft overworld. At this time, a working model has not yet been developed, but the inputs have been collected and processed. 

I'm limited by the availibility of cloud GPUs, so I may go a while without updating anything. I haven't been able to my Radeon to work with Tensorflow, so testing will be limited for only every few updates.
